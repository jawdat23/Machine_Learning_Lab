I had to make a copy of the active users, as I have to iterate every time for each transaction and make sure its user is active, using a generator will only make me able to iterate once, and it is probably that the number of users is relevantly low, and it will not take much of a memory and storage.\n",

        "3.   The complexity of this code is O(M + Nlog(M)) where N is the number of the transactions, and M is the number of users, and in case M is low the complexity will be only O(N), taking in consideration that the number of categories in very low also.\n",

In case we can make sure that the non-active users are not active for real. i.e. no empty rows or values other than 1 and 0, and we can make sure that the user_id in the transactions table is exisited for sure in the users table, then we can make a list of the non-active users only, which is 9 times smaller, and check if the user_id for the transaction is not in this list. This will make searching somehow faster, and the storage space needed is less.\n",
